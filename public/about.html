<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Kyle and I'm having a bit of a existential crisis on what I should do next with my career, so 
  I have recently given myself the task of learning how to become a developer. May God have mercy on all of our souls.</p>

<p>I came to Australia over 10 years ago on a two week trip that never ended (apart from a hiatus during COVID).
  I have always loved living in Oz, and have been lucky enough to get to the country at a time that ecommerce was really starting to take off.
</p>

<p>Within the last 10 months I joined Klaviyo; it's a terrific company with a top notch product...however there are some areas with the business that have really
  troubled me, and it has really made me sick of being an expendable employee. I want to start giving myself the opportunity to create what I'd like and allow the market
  to be my ultimate boss. Here goes nothing....
